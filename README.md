# asm-minilibc
This project was the only assembly project from my second year at EPITECH (2017-2018)

The goal was to create a **dynamic ELF library** to replace some of the [standard C library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) functions.

<br>

Language: **x86-64 assembly**

Group size: **1**

Project duration: **~1 month** (26/02/2018 - 25/03/2018)

Compilation: **on GNU/Linux via Makefile**

Assembly files are compiled with the [**nasm assembler**](https://www.nasm.us/).

## Passed tests:

```
- strncmp:       0%
- strchr:       70%
